# ChatDebug

This mod allows you to view the JSON for all chat messages that you receive.
You can view it with nice formatting and syntax highlighting in a popup window,
and also copy it to your clipboard.

I made this to help me with developing plugins, and also to make it easier to take
a look behind the scenes for some "click here to do something" chat messages on other servers.

You can also disable this mod in the settings, accessible via [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).
This mod requires [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).
